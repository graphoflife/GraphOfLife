TODO

Collect data per agent
    - Reproduction tokens
    - Allocated tokens distribution
    - percentage allocated to self relative to other

Cross parameter scatter plots

Each iteration, zoom in at one agent and look how tokens move, who wins, does he reconnect and so on

Visualizer class

__COMPETITION TODO

redistribute tokens according to biggest network size or something
(different redistribution rules)
    (maybe keep largest 10 ones or something like that)
       make option, that having movers to other networks counts as connected (no priority)
simulation manager with exchange of tokens between them, such that there is a competition between them
experimenting making more links (multiple at once)
reproduction generalization, can decide themselves to make arbitrary many new connections
decide which options are part of each simulation and which options are the same for all simulations
(like keeping one token maybe, because they could habe a systematic advantage, but still experiment with it and
look if that is whats actually happening, namely that only simulations that keep one token get bigger because its easier (hypothesis))

Bug that 1 token gets lost each iteration in CompetitionSingle

Are there power laws?

Is the fine structure constant somewehere to be found as an emergent number?
